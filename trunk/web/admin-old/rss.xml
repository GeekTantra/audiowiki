Comment on police role in dealing with religious conversion:Iam talking from chattisgarh many hindus have been converted as christians by missionaries because of that many goondas or troublemaker come and destroy the houses churches and hit the people it is very bad when they complaint to police they were silent and those people are supporting hindus only and they are not taking any case as per my concern they take both the parties for example hindus and christians makes mistakes means both of them should be punished then only it will be perfect i have seen wherever bjp goverment is there the religious problems starts..

Beating of studnets in Ambikapur:  "In Ambikapur the police have done the latti charge on PG college students.  In Sarguja, we have head office in Ambikapur.  Police have beaten the students left and right.  This incident happened on Feb 15 around 2:12pm.  Because of police behaviour the vice president in the college and NSU department are talking on this issue that police should apologise to the students.  Since the apology has not been done, the vice president of the college and the assistant professor of the college are talking on this issue.  Since the latti charge was happening the police have put the students in the room and beating them left and right.  The NSU department spoke that since the police have taken the laws in their hands, it is not right to beat the students.  Singdeva and Amarjit from the head office are making a meeting on this issue and trying to rectify about this serious issue. This is Prakash Gupta from CGNet."

Hi, this is Annimanadik from Kunkuri of Jashpur district. I have come here to learn and talk about the human develpment publication of social service for 10 days and I am sure that when we collect all the necessary information of all the problems, we can make a report and publish it and I am sure by 10 days we can make it up so that every local person from Chhattisgarh and Jashpur districts can give information on their issues and this information reaches to all the people.  Thank you.  Amen.

Shivsena attacks: "On Valentine's day, Shivsena were protesting and not allowing the lovers to participate in Valentines day.  In fact, on 14th Feb the police were watching over the protest.  Shivsena people made many lovers either to tie the rakhee or call them as brothers and sisters.  Lovers on Valentines day, they used to go to parks or give greetings or share SMS through mobile.  At one point of time, one of the couples had come to Sanjya Park Sarjuna Nagar.  When the couple saw the Shivsena Batalion they ran from there but they were found, so the boy told the Shivsena that the girl is his sister.  Once he told them Shivsena made the boy to tie the rakhee on the girls hand.  Because of that both of them became shamed.  -Prakash"

Got Presidents medal by giving false information:  "Sarpanch has given false information and put the dust on officers' faces.  The Sarpanch has given false information about cleansing and developing the village, and for that the President has awarded him Rs. 50,000 of cash and gold medal but the village people are telling there are some places where the Sarpanch have not taken any action on this.  And in Gram Panchayat one of the leaders by name Paras has told that he cleansed Nirmalpur Village but I don't know about this.  I think the part about Nirmalpur Village cleansing is a joke.  That is what I feel.  This is Vikas Gupta from Bhakatvar.  For further information call me on 9320071813."
